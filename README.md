# Python-Notes
I'm learning Python, so in this repository I'll be uploading all my Python learning via codes.
All the codes are well documented, hence you will be able to understand all the codes properly, and these codes would
be enough for understanding the basics of Python and get into the world of Python.
Hope it helps you all!
